# Recipe Sharing Platform

This project is a learning exercise for the ALX Frontend specialization. It scaffolds a Vite-powered React application styled entirely with Tailwind CSS so future tasks can focus on building the full recipe experience (home page, detail view, and submission form).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 10+

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Start the Vite dev server and open the printed URL to see the Tailwind verification view:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Tailwind Configuration

Tailwind scans `index.html` plus every file under `src/` for class usage. The directives live in `src/index.css`, and the verification UI is rendered from `src/App.jsx`.
